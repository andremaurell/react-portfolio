            My name is Andr√© Maurell, I am 22 years old and I'm a Software
            Developer. I am graduating in Computer Engineering and currently I'm
            in the last semester. My main focus is Frontend development, but I
            can work as a fullstack if necessary.

              Currently, I work as a Junior Front-end Developer, where I apply
              my knowledge to create intuitive and efficient user interfaces.
              Over the past year of concentrating on Front-end development, I
              had the opportunity to work with a startup, which reinforced my
              confidence in developing everything from simple projects, like
              responsive landing pages, to more complex systems involving
              backend API rest, such as forms and scheduling systems.
